3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
=============================

**Problem Statement**

    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


**Example 1:**

.. code-block::
    Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1

    Output: Intersected at '2'

    Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
    From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A;
    There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
